# NEW RULES
To buy time during negotiations, use the tactic of 'calibrated questions'â€”queries with no fixed answers that the other side can respond to. These questions give your counterpart the illusion of control, making them believe they have the answers and power. Meanwhile, you gain time to devise a strategy to win the negotiation.

## THE SMARTEST DUMB GUY IN THE ROOM
Answering your calibrated questions should demamd deep emotional strengths and tactical phychological insights.

Here are some examples of calibrated questions:

1. What challenges are you facing in this situation?
2. How can we address your concerns?
3. What is most important to you in this agreement?
4. How would you like to see this resolved?
5. What are your priorities right now?
6. What factors led you to this decision?
7. How can we move forward from here?
8. What would you need from us to feel comfortable with this deal?
9. How do you see this benefiting both of us?
10. What would it take to make this work for you?

Before negotiating, understand human psychology: we are all crazy, unstable, irrational, impulsive, and emotionally driven machines. Raw intelligence and mathematical logic only help us hide our true selves and put on masks.

Avoid following a scripted predetermined sequence of actions, offers, and counteroffers designed to achieve a specific outcome. For example you would think that trying A, B, C, D will give you X but real-world negotiations are far more unpredictable and complex. Unlike dealing with a robot, where a specific code or algorithm yields a certain answer, negotiation requires flexibility. You might need to do A, then D, and perhaps Q, because the outcome is often uncertain.

## Book
Like a contractor building a house, this book is constructed from the ground up: first comes the big slabs of foundation, then the necessary load-bearing walls, the elegant but impermeable roof, and the lovely interior decorations.
